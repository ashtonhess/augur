# CS4320 Group 1 Sprint1

Group Members:

## Project Description

Our team plans to create new API endpoints allowing users to pass a contributor's email as a parameter. The endpoints will then return data on the contributions of the contributor with the specifiec email address (if they exist). The data returned on a successful operation of these endpoints will be similar to the data already being fetched by existing endpoints, with the distinction of these new endpoints being contributor specific.   

## Progress report (indication about whether or not to update scope):

Feature branches were created off of the main branch of our repository. Three of these branched were created in total, one for each proposed API endpoint to be created. The names of these branches are "contributions-by-email", "lines-by-email", and "comments-by-email". Brief descriptions of the features to be implemented are provided in the README file for each branch.  

## Team reflection (obstacles encountered, reflections, goals):

The biggest obstacle encountered by our team this Sprint was the issue of time. The first issue was an incompatibility with eachother's schedules, leading to confusion over the scheduling of our first meeting with Dr. Goggins. Because of this confusion and an issue with communication over email, our team was unable to have our first meeting with Dr. Goggins until a week and a half after other teams had their meetings. This led to us starting off vastly behind and having to ask for an extension on the Sprint1 deliverable. In addition, differences in personal schedules in the group made communication and meetings difficult, as we are all rerely free at the same time. Despite these issues, our team has been ablee to pull together enough to complete this Sprint and give us a good starting point for Sprint2. Reflecting on the obstacles encountered during this Sprint, we now now how important it is for our group to cominicate with eachother and establish meeting times as early as possible. Taking this approach in future Sprints will hopefully allow us to avoid many of the difficulties encountered during Sprint1.
