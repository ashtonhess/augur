# CS4320 Group 1 Sprint1

Group Members:

Ashton Hess, Tyler Wilkins, Solomon DellaPenna, Jayson Ashford

## Project Description

Our team plans to create new API endpoints allowing users to pass a contributor's email as a parameter. The endpoints will then return data on the contributions of the contributor with the specifiec email address (if they exist). The data returned on a successful operation of these endpoints will be similar to the data already being fetched by existing endpoints, with the distinction of these new endpoints being contributor specific.

## Progress report (indication about whether or not to update scope):

In the course of this Sprint, our group was able to successfully deploy Augur on an AWS Server (with substantial help from Dr. Goggins), define what we would do for our project, define initial requirements for our project, and identify and lay out use cases for our project.

Augur was successfully deployed with Dr. Goggin's help on Monday November 15, 2021 over Zoom between 8:00pm and 9:30pm. A link to the server's endpoint is not provided here as Dr. Goggins was able to witness and verify that the server was running successfully during this meeting.

In regards to our group's structure, we were able to find ways to communicate (over text and discord) and overcome vast differences in personal schedules. Our group was able to discuss our strengths and determine what type of project would suit our combined skills well. This discussion led us to choose a project with an emphasis on backend development, as the majority of the group has little experience with frontend development in Python.

After identifying what we wanted to do for out project (which is described above), our group was able to identify and describe requirements for our project. These requirements are described in a spreadsheet format which is linked above. In addition to these requirements, our group was able to identify and describe use cases for our project. These use cases, described following the provided use case format, are linked in an online document above. 

## Team reflection (obstacles encountered, reflections, goals):

The biggest obstacle encountered by our team this Sprint was the issue of time. The first issue was an incompatibility with eachother's schedules, leading to confusion over the scheduling of our first meeting with Dr. Goggins. Because of this confusion and an issue with communication over email, our team was unable to have our first meeting with Dr. Goggins until a week and a half after other teams had their meetings. This led to us starting off vastly behind and having to ask for an extension on the Sprint1 deliverable. In addition, differences in personal schedules in the group made communication and meetings difficult, as we are all rerely free at the same time. Despite these issues, our team has been ablee to pull together enough to complete this Sprint and give us a good starting point for Sprint2. Reflecting on the obstacles encountered during this Sprint, we now now how important it is for our group to cominicate with eachother and establish meeting times as early as possible. Taking this approach in future Sprints will hopefully allow us to avoid many of the difficulties encountered during Sprint1.
